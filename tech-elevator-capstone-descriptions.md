# READMEs for Tech Elevator Capstone Projects
These projects are listed in chronological order in which they were completed.

## Book Search Command Line Application
Developed by using beginning knowledge of Java, IntelliJ, and Git as a mid-module project for Module One of Tech Elevator’s Coding Bootcamp, this is a command line application that allows users to search and filter through a body of data in a hard-coded array containing books, imitating a bookstore. This body of data is stored in a separate text file. Each book within the array includes the title, author, year of publication, and price. The results of a user’s search are displayed on the console.

### Technical Skills Used
Java, IntelliJ, Git

### Demonstrated Skills and Knowledge
* Declaring and assigning values to variables and constants
* Using boolean expressions to write conditional code
* Using arrays, collections, and loops
* Transforming data through:
   * Parsing strings into numeric data types
   * Using methods of the String class for text processing and manipulation


## Lending Catalog Command Line Application
Developed by using knowledge of Java, IntelliJ, Git, and Unit Testing (JUnit). Expanded upon the Book Search Application listed above, to include movies and books, through building a command line application with a catalog of items users can lend to one another. The dataset is imported from multiple text files.

### Technical Skills Used
Unit Testing (JUnit), Java, IntelliJ, Git

### Demonstrated Skills and Knowledge
* Using an unordered collection
* Reading and parsing files
* Writing to files
* Transforming data through:
   * Splitting and parsing strings
   * Using methods of the String class for text processing and manipulation
* Implementing and using classes
* Implementing polymorphism through utilization of an interface


## E-Commerce Data Management Application
Constructed a back-end application using PostgreSQL, E/R diagrams, Integration Testing, Java, IntelliJ, and Git, that allows a company’s employees to manage customer, product, and sales data. This includes the ability to view the list of products and, add, update, or delete product data.

### Technical Skills Used: 
PostgreSQL, E/R diagrams, Integration Testing, Java, IntelliJ, Git

### Demonstrated Skills and Knowledge
* Writing and executing SQL statements using SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and ORDER BY
* Using the JOIN clause to select data from more than one table
* Writing SQL statements to add, modify, and delete database rows
* Implementing DAOs to facilitate interactions with a database
* Writing integration tests for DAO methods


## E-Commerce Shopping Cart Application
Coded a back-end application that utilizes REST API and allows authorized users to view, add, update, and delete products in their shopping cart, as well as view their subtotal and cart total. Further expanded upon in a later project listed below.

### Technical Skills Used
Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, E/R diagrams, Integration Testing, Java, IntelliJ, Git

### Demonstrated Skills and Knowledge
* Using the DAO pattern to access data in a SQL database
* Writing code to get data from a REST API
* Implementing server-side code to create a RESTful API
* Using Auth to control access to REST API endpoints


## E-Commerce Online Store (Front-End Only)
Developed a fully front-end online store through Vue.js, HTML, CSS, and Responsive Design that allows a retailer to sell their products. Customers can search for particular items and view a list of products. By clicking through the website, they can also view more detailed information about each individual product and add products to their personal shopping cart.

### Technical Skills Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Responsive Design

### Demonstrated Skills and Knowledge
* Creating HTML and using semantic elements
* Styling with CSS and mapping layouts with grid and flexbox
* Using JavaScript arrays and loops
* Manipulating DOM
* Implementing event handling and listeners
* Using data from an event object


## E-Commerce Online Store (Full-Stack)
Created a full-stack application using agile methodology in collaboration with a team. Developed through the use of Java, REST API, and SQL, this application allows authorized consumer users to view product details and add, update, and delete products in their shopping cart, as well as view their subtotal and cart total. Expanded that functionality into an online setting through HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, and responsive design. Customers can also view the list of available products and search for specific items.

### Technical Skills Used: 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Responsive Design, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, E/R diagrams, Integration Testing, Java, IntelliJ, Git

### Demonstrated Skills and Knowledge
* Creating HTML and using semantic elements
